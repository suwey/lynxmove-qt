LynxMove Qt is an open-source and cross-platform software framework for neuroprosthesis control, written in C++ and Qt.

It currently supports the LynxMotion robot arms, and has been tested on the AL5D model. The software uses the QextSerialPort library to connect with the serial port (using the USB-to-Serial-Adapter).

LynxArm is a separate MATLAB class offering comparable functionality as LynxMove Qt, for those who work in MATLAB/Simulink.
